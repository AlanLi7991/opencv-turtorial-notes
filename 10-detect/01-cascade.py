# Q1: What is Cascade Classifier?
# from the document
# "It is
#   a machine learning based approach
#   where a cascade function trained
#   from a lot of positive and negative images
#   then used to detect objects in other images"
#
# in simple word, it finds objects on the input image by trained data
#
# Q2: What cascade explanation? What is the explanation of the ...?
# from dictionary explain
# "a small waterfall, typically one of several that fall in stages down a steep rocky slope"
# the keypoint is "stages" just as same as in the algorithm logic
#
#
# Q3: Why the algorithm will generate beyond 160000 features?
# the features calculate base on kernel matrix
# not just like the contours detector only use one kernel, maybe the sobel
#       (one type) * (one size)
# in the algorithm it uses
#       (differ type) * (differ size)
# then the result will bigger than 160000 at 24x24 window size
#
#
# Q4: Why the algorithm use 6000 features as last?
# even tough algorithm get 160000 features, they are not equally useful for result
# some of them are total nonsense, we discard them,
# select the features with a minimum error rate and assign a weight component
#
# correct ratio = w1*feature1 + w2*feature2 + ..... + w6000*feature6000
#
# the paper says
#   "Even 200 features provide detection with 95% accuracy.
#    Their final setup had around 6000 features."
#
# Q5: What's the main problem of the algorithm?
# the main problem of the algorithm is too much feature and computer
#   1. we need different sizes and types kernel for convolution
#   2. each correct ratio involves too much feature needs to be evaluated one by one
# the two problems cost too much time, we need speed up.
#
# Q6: How to speed up too many features?
# use the integral image, combine the individual image in one by fill 0 of empty pixels
# like the issue:
# https://datasciencechalktalk.com/2019/07/16/haar-cascade-integral-image/
#
#
# Q6: How to speed up to correct predict?
# that why the algorithm call "CASCADE"
# it separates the feature in different groups,
# if the first group failed, it fails all
#
# document refer:
#   "The authors' detector had 6000+ features
#    with 38 stages with 1, 10, 25, 25 and 50 features
#    in the first five stages."
#
# Q8: How can I get my own *.xml trained file?
# OpenCV provides 4 program:
#
#   * opencv_createsamples
#   * opencv_annotation
#   * opencv_traincascade
#   * opencv_visualisation.
#
# for training the *.xml fileï¼Œ and give a tutorial in the next chapter
#
#
