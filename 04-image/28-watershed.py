# Q1: What is WaterShed?
# the algorithm from an idea
# "any grayscale image can be viewed as a topographic surface
# where high intensity denotes peaks and hills
# while low intensity denotes valleys."
#
# Wiki: Inter-pixel watershed[edit]
# S. Beucher and F. Meyer introduced an algorithmic inter-pixel implementation of the watershed method, [5] given the following procedure:
# 1. Label each minimum with a distinct label. Initializing a set of S with the labeled nodes.
# 2. Extract from S a node x of minimal altitude F, that is to say F(x) = min{F(y) | y âˆˆ S}. Attribute the label of x to each non-labeled node y adjacent to x, and insert y in S.
# 3. Repeat Step 2 until S is empty.
#
# Q2: How does the watershed algorithm work?
# 1. use dilate to find a certain background area
# 2. use distance transform to find a certain foreground area
# 3. label unknown area as low altitude (label = 0)
# 4. label certain area as high altitude (label = 1...n)
# 5. flood the water from a label, turn unknown area(0) to certain (1..n)
# 6. repeat the step5 from the lowest altitude pixel position,
# 7. step6 makes sure the waterflood always start from valleys
# 8. after all unknown area to get an altitude label
# 9. extract the high altitude as foreground, low altitude as background
#
# Q2: How to control water flood?
# as the Wiki describe
#
# with the label, the algorithm will not begin from a random position
#
# the 1 ... n label denotes a start position to flood
# the 0 label denotes the points which are not labeled y in step2
#
# when img_color labeled a position and inject it to S
# then it is not the minimum altitude of the next
#
# it will start from a position labeled, not unknown, not random
# repeat and repeat, it will work like the waterflood merging to the contours
#
# finally the contours is watershed, opencv assign it to -1
