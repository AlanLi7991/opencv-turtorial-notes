#
# Q1: What is "Hough Transform"?
# The Hough Transform is a popular technique to detect the various shape
#
# Q2: What is the keypoint of "Hough Transform"?
# if you can represent that shape in a mathematical form.
# It can detect the shape even if it is a little bit broken or distorted.
#
# Q3: What could the Hough algorithm do?
# 1. define a shape with mathematics
# 2. create a histogram container for statistics
# 3. loop every potential combination
# 4. take a threshold to get the result
#
# Q4: Why does "Hough Lines" use 1000 to draw?
# the mathematical define
# 1. use a polar coordinate system for statistics
# 2. target line is too normal for polar magnetic
# can not represent the length of a line
# so 1000 large is enough to cross the image

# the first param is œÅ(rho), the maximum possible distance is the diagonal length of the image.

# last parameter is threshold, if it is too bigger, it will return to None
