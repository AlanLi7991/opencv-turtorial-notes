# python-tutorial-notes

This is my personal learning note of [OpenCV-Python Tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) for beginners. 

It starts from **"Basic Operate"** to **"Machine Learning"** step by step.

At last, I concluded a mind map of this tutorial.

## Mind Map



## Run Sample

Running sample should use "cwd" as work directory. 

```SH
cd python-tutorial-notes/cwd
python ../gui/images.py
```

## Notes

Most of notes are comment at code file.

Documents about feature, camera, machine learning also publicized on [my blog](http://alanli7991.github.io) and written by English.
