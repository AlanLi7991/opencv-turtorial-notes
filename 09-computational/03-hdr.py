# Q1: What is HDR?
# document definition:
#   "High-dynamic-range imaging (HDRI or HDR) is a technique
#    used in imaging and photography
#    to reproduce a greater dynamic range of luminosity
#    than is possible with standard digital imaging or photographic techniques."
# in simple word
# HDR is a technique to get a greater dynamic range of luminosity than it should be.
#
# luminosity:
# luminous quality
#
# Q2: what problem HDR want to solve?
# the document proposes a hypothesis
#   "While the human eye can adjust to a wide range of light conditions,
#    most imaging devices use 8-bits per channel,
#    so we are limited to only 256 levels."
# in simple word, (In a word)machine is not as good as the human eye can handle the condition-light
# so in sometimes
#   "bright regions may be overexposed, while the dark ones may be underexposed"
# HDR can solve this problem with multiple images.
#
# Q2: the theory of HDR?
# HDR steps
#   1. use sequence images taken with different exposure values.
#   2. convert 8 bits per channel to 32-bit float values to get a much wider dynamic range
#   3. combine these exposures via algorithms to estimate the cameraâ€™s response function
#   4. merge the results to a single image
#   5. converted back to 8-bit(this process is called tone mapping) to view it
#
# Q3: the popular algorithms of HDR?
# there are two algorithms
#   1. Debevec
#   2. Robertson
#
# Q4: what are the differences between those algorithms?
# I don't know, as my colleague said:
# "every method that uses multiple exposure results merging to a single image can be called HDR
# Debevec & Robertson only two of them, most of the HDR algorithm is private to company or laboratory"
#

# Tonemap HDR image
# We map the 32-bit float HDR data into the range[0..1].
# Actually, in some cases the values can be larger than 1 or lower the 0,
# so notice we will later have to clip the data in order to avoid overflow.
#
# gamma:
#   positive value for gamma correction.
#   Gamma value of 1.0 implies no correction,
#   gamma equal to 2.2f is suitable for most displays.
#   Generally gamma > 1 brightens the image and gamma < 1 darkens it.
